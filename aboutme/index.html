    <h2>Jared Sanchez</h2>
    <p>I am Jared and I am studying applied technology because I want to become a professional web developer. I recently graduate in Cybersecurity at Ensign College. It was a great experience studying in Utah and learning a new language.</p>
    <p>I really like to play soccer and play the guitar in my free time. Even though I am not a great musician and soccer player, I really like to spend my free time doing both.  On the other hand, one of my favorite hobbies is collecting ties, actually, I have a collection of more than 100 ties. Some Saturdays I meet up with some friends to interchange ties.</p>
    <p>I am currently working as an IT Administrator in a company in Lindon. I really enjoy my job because I have the chance to participate in different IT projects and learn from my coworkers who have a lot of experience in this field.</p>
    <p>I was born at the covenant and I had the blessing to enjoy the gospel with my parents and siblings. I served at the Peru Lima East mission, which was 20 minutes close to my home. It was a great experience serving the mission close to home because I was able to visit the people that I taught. My favorite scripture is <b>Ether 12:6</b> at the book of Mormon and my favorite quote is <i><b>"The choices we make determine out destiny"</b></i> by President Thomas S. Monson. </p>
